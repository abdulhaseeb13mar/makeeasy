Warm over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the white chocolate has fully melted. Pour into a large glass measuring cup, stir in the remaining milk, followed by the vanilla, and then refrigerate until no warmer than 70°F, about 1 hour. (If you’re in a hurry, this process can be sped up with an ice bath; if not, it can be done up to a week in advance, then brought to 70°F at room temperature before use.)\nLine two 8-inch aluminum cake pans with parchment, and coat the pans and parchment lightly with cooking spray. Position a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 350°F.\nSift the flours and baking powder into a medium bowl, and whisk thoroughly for up to a minute to fully combine.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the sugar, salt, nutmeg, and egg yolks. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase the speed to high. Whip until extremely pale and thick, and roughly doubled in volume, about 3 minutes.\nReduce the speed to medium low, and drizzle in the oil, followed by the white chocolate-milk mixture, pouring each in a steady stream. Whisk in the flour mixture gently by hand to form a thin, lump-free batter, then fold once or twice with a flexible spatula to ensure that the batter is well mixed from the bottom up. Divide evenly between the prepared pans, about 26 oz. (about 3-3/4 cups) of batter per pan.\nMake the buttercream:\nFill a medium saucepan with 1 or 2 inches of water, and bring to a boil over high heat.\nMeanwhile, combine the egg whites with the sugars, salt, and cream of tartar in a large glass or ceramic bowl, stirring with a flexible spatula to combine. Place over the pan of water, and adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer.\nCook the egg whites, stirring and scraping the bowl continuously with the spatula, until warmed to 165°F. Remove from the heat, and transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip on high speed until the meringue is thick, glossy, and cooled to about 90°F.\nReduce the speed to medium high, and add the butter 2 Tbs. at a time, one addition right after the next, followed by the vanilla. Stop the mixer, and pour in the melted white chocolate, then immediately begin mixing at medium speed. When the white chocolate seems mostly incorporated, scrape the bowl and whisk, then rewhip on high for a few seconds until smooth.\nThe buttercream should be glossy and hold stiff peaks. (Properly made, a cup of buttercream will weigh about 6 oz., with a temperature around 72°F.) Use right away, or transfer to a gallon-size zip-top bag and freeze until needed (thaw to about 72°F and rewhip before use).\nAssemble and decorate the cake:\r\nCarefully remove the cake layers from the pans by inverting onto racks, then flipping them top side up onto another rack. Level the layers with a serrated knife, and place one on a large, flat serving plate, cut side up. Cover with 1-1/2 cups buttercream, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Top with the second layer, cut side down, and cover with a 1-1/2-cup layer of buttercream. Spread another cup of buttercream around the side of the cake in a thin, even layer, then refrigerate the cake, uncovered, until the buttercream is cold and firm, about 35 minutes.\r\nRewhip the remaining frosting, and generously coat the chilled cake in a thick layer of buttercream. Use the back of a spoon to create old-fashioned swoops and swirls of frosting, or whatever design you prefer.\r\nTop the cake with tart red fruits like fresh raspberries or cherries, if you like. (Before serving, set the cake out at room temperature until warmed to an internal temperature of about 70°F, as the buttercream can seem greasy when cold.) Store at room temperature until ready to serve, up to 24 hours."

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking, until the mixture is thick like pudding, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and press plastic wrap directly onto the surface. Refrigerate until completely cool, about 11/2 hours.\r\nWhen you¿re ready to assemble the cake, finish the frosting: Remove the malted mixture from the refrigerator and whisk until creamy. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 8 minutes. Add large spoonfuls of the malted mixture, beating 1 to 2 minutes after each addition and scraping down the bowl as needed (the frosting will look separated). Continue beating until the frosting comes together and is light and fluffy, about 3 more minutes. (Do not chill!)\r\nAssemble the cake: Place 1 cake layer on a platter. Spread with 1 heaping cup of the frosting. Top with the second cake layer. Cover the top and side with more frosting, then build up a ring around the top of the cake with the remaining frosting to create a nest. Refrigerate the cake until the frosting firms up, about 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, make the topping: Toss the shredded wheat in a large bowl with the melted butter, then add the sugar and toss again. Spread in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees F until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Melt the chocolate in a large microwave-safe bowl in 20-second intervals, stirring, until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool slightly, then stir in the shredded wheat mixture until completely coated. Press the topping all over the top and side of the cake. Refrigerate until set, at least 30 minutes or overnight. Fill the nest with candy eggs."

Pulse until the dough starts to clump together, adding a drizzle more water, 1 tsp at a time, if the dough feels dry – try not to add too much or the pastry will be tough.

Break into 2 pieces, one a little larger than the other, wrap in cling film, pat into flat discs and chill for 30 mins.\nHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Remove the larger piece of pastry from the fridge – if it feels a little firm, leave at room temperature for 20 mins to soften. On a floured surface, roll out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Use the pastry to line a 20-22cm metal pie plate or tin, leaving a little excess pastry overhanging – trim with a pair of scissors if necessary. Line the base with baking parchment and baking beans, and blind-bake for 20 mins. Mix the cherries, cornflour and sugar in a bowl.

Roll out the remaining pastry to the same thickness as before, large enough to cover the pie. Slide the pastry onto a well-floured sheet of baking parchment and, using your favourite mini biscuit cutter or the wide end of a piping nozzle, stamp out a scattering of shapes – we used a 2cm star cutter, but hearts or circles would look nice – just don’t cut out too many or the pastry will collapse. Brush the egg white over the edge of the pie rim and all over the lid. Place a few cut-out shapes back on the pastry, if you like. Carefully lift the baking parchment and pastry, and slide the pastry lid onto the pie, removing the parchment. Trim the excess pastry, then use a fork to press the lid to the base. Bake for 35 mins.\nBrush the pie with the remaining egg white and scatter with the remaining 1 tbsp sugar. Bake for a further 5 mins until golden brown and bubbling.

Scoop the dough into 1-1/2 to 2 tablespoon portions and place at least 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.

Rotate the baking sheets once during bake time. The cookies won't get their crackly tops until the very end of cook time or after removal from the oven. Place the baking sheets on wire racks to cool. Once they have cooled and firmed up, use a spatula to release the cookies from the parchment.\r\nAssembly:\r\nOption 1: Place a scoop of ice cream on the underside of a cookie. Use the back of a spoon to carefully spread the ice cream, then top with another cookie. TIP: Pop the cookies into the freezer for 30 minutes to get them firmed up before spreading the ice cream on.\r\nOption 2 (pictured): Using a sharp knife, cut directly through a pint of ice cream, making thin disc-like slices. Peel off the outer paper from each slice of ice cream and immediately place it between two cookies. Note: I recommend wiping down the outside of the pint before cutting into it. The bottoms of some ice cream containers have a little lip to them, so I cut that off first.\r\nAdd nuts, sprinkles, or mini chocolate chips to the outer edges of the sandwiches.
